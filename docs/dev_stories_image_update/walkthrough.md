# Walkthrough - Dev Stories Image Update

I have updated the "Dev Stories" page to include an image for the new article "Challenging IT/AI Qualifications".

## Changes
### Data
- Updated `data/dev-stories/episodes.ts` to reference the new image.

### Assets
- Created `public/dev-stories/qualifications_challenge.png`.
  - **Note**: Due to a temporary issue with the AI image generator, I have used a placeholder image (copy of `roast_plus_origin.png`) for now. You can replace this file with the final image when available.

## Verification Results
### Automated Checks
- Validated that `episodes.ts` points to the correct image usage.
- Confirmed file existence of `qualifications_challenge.png`.
